The `healthequal` package provides computational tools for calculating 21 summary measures of health inequality.

# Installation

You can install the released version of healthequal from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("healthequal")
```

The development version can be installed from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("WHOequity/healthequal")
```

## Measures of health inequality included in `healthequal`:

The following summary measures of health inequality are included in the `healthequal` package:

### Simple measures

-   Difference (`d`)
-   Ratio (`r`)

### Disproportionality measures (ordered dimensions)

-   Absolute concentration index (`aci`)
-   Relative concentration index (`rci`)

### Regression-based measures (ordered dimensions)

-   Slope index of inequality (`sii`)
-   Relative index of inequality (`rii`)

### Variance measures (non-ordered dimensions)

-   Between-group variance (`bgv`)
-   Between-group standard deviation (`bgsd`)
-   Coefficient of variation (`covar`)

### Mean difference measures (non-ordered dimensions)

-   Mean difference from mean - unweighted and weighted (`mdmu` and `mdmw`)
-   Mean difference from best-performing subgroup - unweighted and weighted (`mdbu` and `mdbw`)
-   Mean difference from reference subgroup - unweighted and weighted (`mdru` and `mdrw`)
-   Index of disparity - unweighted and weighted (`idisu` and `idisw`)

### Disproportionality measures (non-ordered dimensions)

-   Theil index (`ti`)
-   Mean log deviation (`mld`)

### Impact measures

-   Population attributable risk (`parisk`)
-   Population attributable fraction (`paf`)

# Package data

The `healthequal` package comes with sample data for users to be able to test the package functions. The `OrderedSample` and `NonorderedSample` data contain data disaggregated by economic status and subnational region, respectively, for a single indicator.

### Ordered and Nonordered data

``` r
data(OrderedSample)
head(OrderedSample)
```

``` r
data(NonorderedSample)
head(NonorderedSample)
```

### Disagregated data

The `OrderedSampleMultipleind` and `OrderedSampleMultipleind` data contain disaggregated data by economic status and subnational region, respectively, for two indicators.

``` r
data(OrderedSampleMultipleind)
head(OrderedSampleMultipleind)
```

``` r
data(NonorderedSampleMultipleind)
head(NonorderedSampleMultipleind)
```

### More info on the datasets

For information about the datasets, type the following commands, which will display the corresponding dataset help file:

``` r
?healthequal::OrderedSample
?healthequal::NonorderedSample
?healthequal::OrderedSampleMultipleind
?healthequal::NonorderedSampleMultipleind
?healthequal::IndividualSample
```

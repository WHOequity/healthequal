\usage{
covar(
  est,
  se = NULL,
  pop,
  scaleval = NULL,
  sim = NULL,
  seed = 123456,
  force = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{est}{The subgroup estimate. Estimates must be available for at least
85\% of subgroups.}

\item{se}{The standard error of the subgroup estimate. If this is missing,
95\% confidence intervals cannot be calculated.}

\item{pop}{The number of people within each subgroup.Population size must be
available for all subgroups.}

\item{scaleval}{The scale of the indicator. For example, the scale of an
indicator measured as a percentage is 100. The scale of an indicator measured
as a rate per 1000 population is 1000. If this is missing, 95\% confidence
intervals cannot be calculated.}

\item{sim}{The number of simulations to estimate confidence intervals.
Default is 100.}

\item{seed}{The random number generator (RNG) state for the confidence
interval simulation. Default is 123456.}

\item{force}{TRUE/FALSE statement to force calculation when more than 85\% of
subgroup estimates are missing.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The estimated COV value, corresponding estimated standard error,
and confidence interval as a \code{data.frame}.
}
\description{
The coefficient of variation (COV) is a relative measure of inequality
that considers all population subgroups. Subgroups are weighted according
to their population share.
}
\details{
COV is calculated by dividing the between-group standard deviation (BGSD)
by the setting average, multiplied by 100. BGSD is calculated as the square
root of the weighted average of squared differences between the subgroup
estimates and the setting average. Squared differences are weighted by each
subgroupâ€™s population share. For more information on this inequality measure
see Schlotheuber (2022) below.

95\% confidence intervals are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation-based
method. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g. 100), with
the mean and standard error of each simulated dataset being the same as the
original dataset. COV is calculated for each of the simulated sample
datasets. The 95\% confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of the COV results. See Ahn (2019) below for further
information.

\strong{Interpretation:} COV only has positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. COV is 0 if there is no
inequality. COV has no unit.

\strong{Type of summary measure:} Complex; relative; weighted

\strong{Applicability:} Non-ordered dimensions of inequality with more than two
subgroups

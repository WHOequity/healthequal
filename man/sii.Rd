\description{
The slope index of inequality (SII) is an absolute measure of inequality
that represents the difference in estimated indicator values between the
most-advantaged and most-disadvantaged, while taking into consideration the
situation in all other subgroups/individuals â€“ using an appropriate
regression model. SII can be calculated using both disaggregated data and
individual-level data. Subgroups in disaggregated data are weighted
according to their population share, while individuals are weighted by
sample weight in the case of data from surveys.
}
\details{
To calculate SII, a weighted sample of the whole population is ranked from
the most-disadvantaged subgroup (at rank 0) to the most-advantaged subgroup
(at rank 1). This ranking is weighted, accounting for the proportional
distribution of the population within each subgroup. The indicator of
interest is then regressed against this relative rank using an appropriate
regression model (e.g., a generalized linear model with logit link), and the
predicted values of the indicator are calculated for the two extremes (rank
1 and rank 0). The difference between the predicted values at rank 1 and
rank 0 (covering the entire distribution) generates the SII value. For more
information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., & Hosseinpoor,
A. R. (2022) below.

\strong{Interpretation:} SII is zero if there is no inequality. Greater absolute
values indicate higher levels of inequality. For favourable indicators,
positive values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the
advantaged, while negative values indicate a concentration of the indicator
among the disadvantaged. For adverse indicators, it is the reverse: positive
values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the disadvantaged,
while negative values indicate a concentration of the indicator among the
advantaged.

\strong{Type of summary measure:} Complex; absolute; weighted

\strong{Applicability:} Ordered; more than two subgroups

\strong{Warning:} The confidence intervals are approximate
and might be biased.

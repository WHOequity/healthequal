\title{Index of Disparity (weighted) (IDISW)}
\usage{
idisw(pop, est, se = NULL, scaleval, sim = NULL, seed = 123456, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{The number of people within each subgroup.
Population size must be available for all subgroups.}

\item{est}{The subgroup estimate.
Estimates must be available for all subgroups.}

\item{se}{The standard error of the subgroup estimate.
If this is missing, 95\% confidence intervals of IDISW cannot be calculated.}

\item{scaleval}{The scale of the indicator. For example, the
scale of an indicator measured as a percentage is 100. The
scale of an indicator measured as a rate per 1000 population is 1000.}

\item{sim}{The number of simulations to estimate 95\% confidence intervals}

\item{seed}{The random number generator (RNG) state for the 95\% confidence
interval simulation}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The estimated IDISW value, corresponding estimated standard error,
and confidence interval as a \code{data.frame}.
}
\description{
The Index of Disparity (IDIS) is a relative measure of inequality that
shows the average difference between each subgroup and the setting
average, in relative terms. In the weighted version (IDISW), subgroups
are weighted according to their population share.
}
\details{
IDISW is calculated as the weighted average of absolute differences
between the subgroup estimates and the setting average, divided by
the setting average, and multiplied by 100. Absolute differences are
weighted by each subgroupâ€™s population share. For more information
on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber, A., & Hosseinpoor, A. R.
(2022) below.

95\% confidence intervals are calculated using a methodology of simulated
estimates. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g., 100)
and IDISW is calculated for each of the simulated samples. The 95\%
confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th centiles of the
IDISW results.

\strong{Interpretation:} IDISW has only positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. IDISW is zero if there is no
inequality.

\strong{Type of summary measure:} Complex; relative; weighted

\strong{Applicability:} Non-ordered; more than two subgroups

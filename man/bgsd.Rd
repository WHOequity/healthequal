\title{Between-group standard deviation (BGSD)}
\usage{
bgsd(pop, est, se = NULL, scaleval, sim = NULL, seed = 123456, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{The number of people within each subgroup.
Population size must be available for all subgroups.}

\item{est}{The subgroup estimate. Estimates must be
available for at least 85\% of subgroups.}

\item{se}{The standard error of the subgroup estimate.
If this is missing, 95\% confidence intervals of BGSD cannot be calculated.}

\item{scaleval}{The scale of the indicator. For example, the
scale of an indicator measured as a percentage is 100. The
scale of an indicator measured as a rate per 1000 population is 1000.}

\item{sim}{The number of simulations to estimate confidence intervals.
Default is 100.}

\item{seed}{The random number generator (RNG) state for the confidence
interval simulation. Default is 123456.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The estimated BGSD value, corresponding estimated standard error,
and confidence interval as a \code{data.frame}.
}
\description{
Between-Group Standard Deviation (BGSD) is an absolute measure of inequality
that considers all population subgroups. Subgroups are weighted according
to their population share.
}
\details{
BGSD is calculated as the square root of the weighted average of squared
differences between the subgroup estimates and the setting average.
Squared differences are weighted by each subgroupâ€™s population share.
For more information on this inequality measure see Schlotheuber,
A., & Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.

95\% confidence intervals are calculated using a methodology of simulated
estimates. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g., 100)
and BGSD is calculated for each of the simulated samples. The 95\%
confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
BGSD results.

\strong{Interpretation:} BGSD has only positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. BGSD is zero if there is no
inequality. It has the same unit as the health indicator.

\strong{Type of summary measure:} Complex; absolute; weighted

\strong{Applicability:} Non-ordered; more than two subgroups

\title{Mean difference from a reference subgroup (weighted) (MDRW)}
\usage{
mdrw(
  pop,
  est,
  se = NULL,
  scaleval,
  reference_subgroup,
  sim = NULL,
  seed = 123456,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{pop}{The number of people within each subgroup.
Population size must be available for all subgroups.}

\item{est}{The subgroup estimate.
Estimates must be available for at least 85\% of subgroups.}

\item{se}{The standard error of the subgroup estimate.
If this is missing, 95\% confidence intervals of MDRW cannot be calculated.}

\item{scaleval}{The scale of the indicator. For example, the
scale of an indicator measured as a percentage is 100. The
scale of an indicator measured as a rate per 1000 population is 1000.}

\item{reference_subgroup}{Identifies a reference subgroup with the value of
1.}

\item{sim}{The number of simulations to estimate 95\% confidence intervals.
Default is 100.}

\item{seed}{The random number generator (RNG) state for the 95\% confidence
interval simulation. Default is 123456.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The estimated MDRW value, corresponding estimated standard error,
and confidence interval as a \code{data.frame}.
}
\description{
An absolute measure of inequality that shows the mean difference between
each population subgroup and a reference subgroup. In the weighted
version (MDRW), subgroups are weighted according to their population share.
}
\details{
The weighted version (MDRW) is calculated as the weighted average of
absolute differences between the subgroup estimates and the estimate for the
reference subgroup. Absolute differences are weighted by each subgroupâ€™s
population share. For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber, A., & Hosseinpoor, A. R. (2022) below.

95\% confidence intervals are calculated using a methodology of simulated
estimates. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g., 100)
and MDRW is calculated for each of the simulated samples. The 95\%
confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the
MDRW results.

\strong{Interpretation:} MDRW only has positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. MDRW is zero if there is no
inequality.

\strong{Type of summary measure:} Complex; absolute; weighted

\strong{Applicability:} Non-ordered; more than two subgroups

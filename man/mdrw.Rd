\usage{
mdrw(
  est,
  se = NULL,
  pop,
  scaleval = NULL,
  reference_subgroup,
  sim = NULL,
  seed = 123456,
  force = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{est}{The subgroup estimate. Estimates must be available for at least
85\% of subgroups.}

\item{se}{The standard error of the subgroup estimate. If this is missing,
95\% confidence intervals cannot be calculated.}

\item{pop}{The number of people within each subgroup.Population size must be
available for all subgroups.}

\item{scaleval}{The scale of the indicator. For example, the scale of an
indicator measured as a percentage is 100. The scale of an indicator measured
as a rate per 1000 population is 1000. If this is missing, 95\% confidence
intervals cannot be calculated.}

\item{reference_subgroup}{Identifies a reference subgroup with the value of 1.}

\item{sim}{The number of simulations to estimate 95\% confidence intervals.
Default is 100.}

\item{seed}{The random number generator (RNG) state for the 95\% confidence
interval simulation. Default is 123456.}

\item{force}{TRUE/FALSE statement to force calculation when more than 85\% of
subgroup estimates are missing.}

\item{...}{Further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
The estimated MDRW value, corresponding estimated standard error,
and confidence interval as a \code{data.frame}.

\description{
The mean difference from a reference point (MDR) is an absolute measure
of inequality that shows the mean difference between each population
subgroup and a defined reference subgroup (e.g. the capital city or region
for data disaggregated by subnational regions).
}
\details{
The weighted version (MDRW) is calculated as the weighted average of
absolute differences between the subgroup estimates and the estimate for the
reference subgroup. Absolute differences are weighted by each subgroupâ€™s
population share. For more information on this inequality measure see
Schlotheuber (2022) below.

95\% confidence intervals are calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation-based
method. The dataset is simulated a large number of times (e.g. 100), with
the mean and standard error of each simulated dataset being the same as the
original dataset. MDRW is calculated for each of the simulated sample
datasets. The 95\% confidence intervals are based on the 2.5th and 97.5th
percentiles of the MDRW results. See Ahn (2019) below for further
information.

\strong{Interpretation:} MDRW only has positive values, with larger values
indicating higher levels of inequality. MDRW is 0 if there is no
inequality. MDRW has the same unit as the indicator.

\strong{Type of summary measure:} Complex; absolute; weighted

\strong{Applicability:} Non-ordered dimensions of inequality with more than two
subgroups

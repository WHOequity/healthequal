Description: Compute 21 summary measures of health inequality and its
    corresponding confidence intervals for ordered and non-ordered
    dimensions using disaggregated data. Measures for ordered dimensions
    (e.g., Slope Index of Inequality, Absolute Concentration Index) also
    accept individual and survey data.
